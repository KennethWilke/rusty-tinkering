# Rusty Tinkering

This repository is intended to store prototype and exploratory Rust crates. These are an output of my learning process, and the quality of the crates will vary pretty greatly. While I aim to write efficient, useful and idiomatic Rust code, that's not quite where I am yet on my journey, though the goal is to trend towards that with time, experimentation and experience.

With that being said, any other newbies should be aware these projects are stylistically more "the way I do/did things" rather than "the way of the proper Rust developer". 

To more experienced Rust devs: please send help! (but really, any actionable feedback or tips via Github issues are greatly appreciated)
